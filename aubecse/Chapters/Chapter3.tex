\subsection{Analysis}
Robot is built using the raspberry-pi, the reason for choosing which over others is made clear in the subsequent chapters. The chassis is built with 4 wheels and an L298N motor driver that is interfaced with the RPI. The gesture signals received trigger the python program to drive the wheels of the robot. The Microsoft Kinect is connected to a Windows PC which hosts the C\# program written to interact with the Kinect. The program can identify the user using the coordinates sent from the sensors and hence the movement tracking is done. On the completion of a gesture, the necessary signals are sent through the SSH tunnel which are then picked up by the robot program.
