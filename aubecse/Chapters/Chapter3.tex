\subsection{Analysis}
The quadcopter is built using the RPi. The RPi was used because of its computational power, portability and immense open-source support. The quadcopter is built with 4 motors, propellers, an IMU sensor, ESC and a RPi native camera that is interfaced with the RPi. The Android app sends JSON-encoded signals to the RPi.The RPi hosts a Python server which decodes the signals received and triggers the appropriate Python program to fly the quadcopter and take pictures. The IMU sensor detects the orientation of the quadcopter and feeds that data to the quadcopter balancing program. The program can then use the roll, pitch and yaw data to compute the required orientation of the quadcopter. The RPi Camera takes images which are processed using OpenCV image processing library on the RPi and saved on the SD Card.
