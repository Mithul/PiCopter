\subsection{Evaluation}
There are several changes that have to be made when flying the quadcopter in varying environments. The PID values change according to the wind conditions and other disturbances. Although the SD Card is securely inserted into the RPi, due to a large amount of vibration caused in the course of the quadcopter's flight, it may loosen leading to connection loss between the RPi and the App. The quadcopter is controlled by the App from a distance of about 10-15 metres since communication occurs via WiFi. Images are taken by a RPi native camera. The quality of the images taken largely depend on the stability of the quadcopter which are subject to the vagaries of the environment.
The pictures taken are stitched and/or reconstructed. This process depends on the number of images taken and the quality of the images.
