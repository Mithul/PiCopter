\subsection{Evaluation}
There are several differences between the Internet-based re- mote control systems and other tele-operating systems. Most of the tele-operating systems are based on private media, by which the transmission delay and data loss rate can be well modelled. The Internet in contrast is a public and shared resource in which various end users transmit data via the complex network simultaneously. The route for data transmission between two end points in a wide area is not fixed for different trials and the collision may be caused when two or more users transmit data via the same route simultaneously. Therefore the transmission efficiency of the Internet is difficult to be modelled at any time period.
