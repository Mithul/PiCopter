Quadcopters are one of the most popular technologies of the 21st century. They have multifarious uses ranging from aerial photogrammetry(photography and 3d positioning of objects), military surveillance, taking panorama shots, movie-making and delivery of products. It is also an extensive area of research, an example of which would be swarm robotics.

Our project delves into aerial photogrammetry i.e. taking pictures of objects/topography and reconstructing 3D representations of it. Since it is extremely difficult to take pictures or videos of places inaccessible to humans, such as caverns, waterfalls, ancient ruins, caves, etc. Such places can be observed and examined with the help of drones.

However very few drones have the stability required to provide stable video for processing or images without excessive noise to generate a panorama image - a representation of a 360 degree angle of physical space.
The drone would be able to take pictures of objects in inaccessible places and reconstruct 3D models of it for obeservation, analysis and study.
